**Feature-Selection Techniques & Cross-Validation**
-> This repository focuses on evaluating the impact of cross-validation and feature selection methods, including filter, wrapper, and PCA, on the performance of machine learning models for regression and classification tasks using six datasets( 3 for regression and 3 for classification).
-> The analysis encompasses siz distinct datasets, facilitating a comprehensive comparison of various feature selection methods. Each dataset is interpreted individually, offering specific insights for both regression and classification tasks. This repository provides valuable insights into the effects of cross-validation and feature selection methods on machine learning model (KNN) performance across diverse datasets, assisting in making informed decisions regarding model selection and feature engineering
